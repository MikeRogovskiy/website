To start work on this project you should download zip file and unpacked it, 

then open unpacked zip folder in any code editor you have (VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) etc)

Before that, install some additionals you need to work on:
1. node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. git version control (https://git-scm.com/)

After all installations, to start editing website you should run in your command line (in code editor):

### `npm install` 

This command will install all nessasary dependencies and libraries, then run 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run deploy`

This command will deploy app on gh-pages, so, all your changes will be available here:<br>
https://easably.github.io/website/#/


To build done project after changes run (this will create a build folder in project root) ready to udate ftp server 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.



Additional commands:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

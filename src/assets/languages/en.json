    "articleThreeText1": "Apps for learning languages promise to teach you how to use a new language just with a computer or phone. They’re <b>similar in concept:</b> daily exercises to teach you an entire language.</br></br> It’s promising, especially if you’re <b>not</b> already immersed in a language environment that will give you the exposure you need to pick up a second language. The question is, <b>are they effective?</b> </br></br> I’m sure you are aware that a <b>language is a complex interconnected system</b> of components that build a way to communicate. I’m talking about morphology, syntax, semantics and other language goddesses. </br></br> Let’s face it.</br></br> <b>Apps help to stay motivated!</b> We live a busy life and we either before or after work. We get a notification and go to the app then choose the simplest way: do exercises on what we know by heart and get our bonuses to feel like ‘mission accomplished’. Do you get it? It's an illusion of progress.</br></br> You can learn how to <b>pronounce sounds and phonemes</b> - but there are plenty of exceptions when the same letter combination is pronounced differently in different words. After three(!) years of living in the UK I was able to correctly pronounce vowel sounds without my decent russian accent. </br></br>You can <b>learn a basic set of English words</b> - you will successfully do your exercises by clicking on the correct answers. Does this have to do with understanding words in a real situation? In real life we ​​come across a huge number of phrases in a varied context that changes their meaning and connotation. That’s confusing and curious.</br></br> <b>You can learn grammar</b> - but will it teach you to use language? Let’s say you are in the middle of conversation and trying to recall the grammar rule of 2 conditionals, then trying to apply to your case and finally saying that, most likely with an error. It takes about 30 seconds or more. A person you are talking to will wait once or twice, if he is British - probably about 5 times, but the situation can hardly be called ‘easy communication’ and most likely the person will start to avoid you.</br></br> The last question: Is it possible to learn how <b>to maintain professional dialogues,</b> for example about banking rules, software architecture or astrophysics? It is difficult if your vocab has just a basic set of words like “good”, “nice to meet you”, “how much does it cost”. </br></br>",
